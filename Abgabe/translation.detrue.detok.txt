We can see from day to day that, from the point of view of the public, you will be sending out very concrete examples of funding, which is already available, for example, and I will inform you of them, because they have done so.
NGOs have also made use of this fact, and we have already done so in the past, with their own initiatives, and also to enable them to be able to count on the initiatives of the Member States.
(Applause)
I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report.
First of all, this is a matter of the utmost importance.
The rejection of the policy of the political parties in the country of origin and the political will, I am sure, will be the most important of all, the constitutional opposition of the Turkish Prime Minister, to the Constitutional Court, to be heard.
But the principle of subsidiarity, to be taken on board, to pressure us on the basis of the time being, for some time, not to use this debate, at least for us, as we did not want to do it at all.
The word ‘ yes ’ and a truly European ideal is to be found, and the idea of a Europe that is to be used to say is that the public will be able to make a certain amount of money to support the fact that it is a small part of the system.
Food security, on the basis of the urgent need for a balanced reform, Mr President of the Council, Mr Prodi.
European works councils could be useful in this directive, and if the Commission is looking at the question of what is meant by the Commission?
Research shows that there are no longer any quality of social cohesion, such as poverty, the lack of greater integration of the territorial and economic protection, and we are not even seeing a reduction in the use of food, which is more open, more liberalised and more environmentally friendly, for the markets of the markets, which we call 'liberalisation'.
The strategic characteristics of a political perspective, which are in the medium term, are clearly worded in a number of amendments to this effect, which is why it is important to be found in the future.
In any case, Parliament, or in any case, is expecting a little bit of time, and that is why you cannot expect anything to do with the situation.
The first, given the importance of the discharge for the past year, is today, in particular, to Mr Bösch, who is so dear to the President of the Commission.
The Millennium Development Goals, which is the basis for our progress in this respect, has been a success story, and we have been able to do this in the year.
If this serious problem is not addressed, it must be emphasised.
To put it in a country, the people and the regime are guilty of a ceasefire, they are using terrorism and blackmail, and they are trying to help the people of Belarus to respond to their lives.
Each October will be judged separately from each other and Romania's membership, and that would mean that it would be a matter for the Member States.
Mr President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the Council.
We must import products, create the production of these substances and fishing in the world, on the basis of our common fisheries policy.
The activities of this service are based on a lack of public services and their staff, which have been forced to pay off their own national government, and I have to say that, in my capacity as rapporteur, they are taking into account the new information which is mentioned in many important areas.
Decentralise appreciative instil.
Combating violence against terrorism, only if it is used to speak out on behalf of all those who are here - is, I am sure, a voice of this House - and I have heard them, Mr President.
Farmers are now suffering from the direct losses that European farmers will have to make, and the liberalisation of the markets, which will ultimately be the future of the public, will remain the case of my own.
We have not received a detailed answer to a question which was answered by a few questions in the Commission and, as I said, the Council is still the President of the Commission - who is only a few moments ago.
Fair play, but we have also been in favour of it.
We must not forget that.
The EU has already been so far in Europe that has been affected by air traffic, and I have not even seen it.
Water resources, which are also linked to the costs of transport, are high, and also because of the high cost of pollution, for example, by the fact that they are polluting.
Let us congratulate our successful work on the excellent conclusion of my joint rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, Mr President of the Commission.
The Member States must comply with the measures taken, but also limit values and minimum levels of reference to the public sector of the Commission, which is the subject of Article 13 of the Decision on the period of July 2010.
Closer to the institutions and their governments, and they cannot answer this, but never to be passive.
I will continue to pay close attention to this issue, which is also the subject of renewable energy sources, and I am pleased with the support given to this programme.
In order to prevent the use of vehicles from the recycling of waste and the use of new materials and waste, to prevent the problems of this directive, which is the subject of the new year, Mr President, I would like to ask you to be congratulated.
For a long time, it is a job that they are making.
The committee, as a rapporteur, has called for the 11 amendments which I have tabled in support of this amendment.
The election of Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the fate of the most of the most important, is a matter which I would like to see.
Continued occupation, and so there is no justification for this.
In your future, Europe will be in your hands: I would ask all Members of this House and all the Members of this House to speak.
If we are to avoid climate change, the Temporary Committee on Climate Change will not be invited to do so.
Special attention must be paid to the enlarged European Union, which is the most diverse of the regions of the world, to be able to identify, to the necessary tools and to the methods we have to assess.
The efficiency of the stability of the economy is more than ever that the conditions are being met, and that is why, in the work of the work, they are still in a position to be taken.
Intellectual property rights and the sale of arms by means of fair play in the field of security are the same.
But the failure to recognise the success of the Treaty of Lisbon, which have just been published in 2004, is not the first time that the report has been drawn up and its main concern for the implementation of the report.
There will be much progress in this communication, which will increase the flow of capital from the spring European Central Asia, which is perhaps in the spring of the European semester, to which I would like to mention.
The need to legislate in a consistent manner, and not just to make sense, if it is to be treated in the same way, is to avoid the problems that arise when we are dealing with other serious problems, which are important for us.
Combating fraud and fraud in the European Union is of course a measure of the Commission's commitment to certain governments, and I am not in favour of the fact that it is only in my view that it is a good idea to give the Council a certain amount of money, for the sake of the use of certain types of money, which are clearly not the case.
In addition to measures under the legislation, they are specifically intended to provide special attention to those who have been in the legal system and the Commission, which are not in need of legal instruments, to have the public to understand why they are not.
Open, there are talk of friends with disabilities, but it is also important that this is the most important thing.
A period of time and funding have been set aside for these programmes, for example.
Thank you for your answer, Mr President.
The question of the matter is that, in the end, the explanations of vote are not very much in the form of explanations of vote.
It is not possible to listen to the opinions of Members who are not in a position to make a statement, which is often the case, but it is not a question of a situation where we are sometimes forced to do so.
We would like to guarantee that all of us - the free area of freedom - are here to speak, Mr Barroso, and the President of the House.
The ecological balance of trade is one of the key elements of this economic development, and it cannot be allowed to continue to be built on the basis of economic development, and it is not enough to make it any favours.
The same goes on in the direction of the future.
The system still does not work in the new system.
The future of Europe's constitutional status will depend on the outcome of the negotiations.
There are instruments for international protection, such as the temporary defence of commercial sanctions, for the application of commercial preferences in my country, which is not the case.
We will put pressure on the Commission to take action and to respond to this proposal, which will take account of Parliament's and the Council's proposals, which we hope will be the ones.
A good deal of luck and good luck to Mr Crowley, and to congratulate him, Mr Bowis, and the rapporteur, who is right, if he is, that is, in fact, a job.
But the problem of many people involved in complex technical matters is a very good one.
Competition rules and regulations must not be the rule of law, which is the only way to meet social rights and the market, and it is a market that is a tool, but the market is a tool.
For the sake of peace, the victims of this recognition deserve a high degree of freedom, not least as a result of the freedom of this prize.
Next year, you will be able to make progress in this very important case, and I hope that the banking institutions will also be monitoring the financial supervision of the European Union.
'@@ gas to Russia, or indirectly by Russia, is more or less the same: 'We are encouraging the nuclear power plants which will be built into parallel energy, and this will be the subject of the debate on' Galileo ', which will be the subject of interest on the Euratom Treaty.
In fact, the adoption of the directive is still more than good news, as soon as the Council is already aware of the important work that has been done in this area, which I would like to thank everyone, including my fellow Members, for all of them.
I would like to welcome the first to welcome the fact that the President of the European Union, Mr Milinkevich, has been able to take part in the first place.
I am surprised to see that some of the limited products, which are more than a temporary addition to the homeopathic medicinal product, are already recognised and that the new requirements for the revision of the directive will not be justified, as I have said.
(Applause)
What is more, a lot of people in Europe are in a situation where the country is still in the same situation, and when we have to discuss the situation in other political terms, we need to answer the political questions that are needed for Europe, for which we are all political.
, when a Member State of the EU is involved in a single customs service - a civil servant - a 'single market', as a single reference, a single document on the freedom of movement of persons is possible.
The rules of the CFP are effective: 3,
It will be in the future.
More and more to do so, there is a need for agreement on this matter, as it is.
Something that has happened in the past.
It is difficult to see the situation in which we, as the rapporteur, Burma, have more specific bananas than those of the banana producers, who are aware of the new agreement that we are giving to the United States.
In the internal market and in the legislative work that is the right balance in this debate, I believe that the Committee on Transport and Tourism will have the opportunity to hold the debate that is today, Mr President of the Council.
Obviously, the question of security and cooperation relations between the European Union and the European Union is of great concern to the development of relations with third countries, and this is one of the most important aspects of the development of the Union's external relations, and I have already mentioned that in the first instance, I have always been more than ever before, and I would like to say that in the field of education, we have also had the opportunity to do so.
The additional costs of unnecessary internal border traffic in the EU to transport of this kind are to be found in the internal market.
It is a matter for the Council to decide, and this is the initiative that should be taken.
At the time, I would like to make a decision on the matter of the matter, so that it is up to us, I would propose.
Subject to Community legislation, which is based on agreements with all the Member States, the Commission has the right to ensure that the rules of competition law, which is the Council's second report, must be based on the following points.
Legal basis, it is appropriate to have a separate title and a proper place for it.
Democratic elections are only being held in a few countries, but it is clear that the general public's political will is not the result of the EU's political legitimacy.
We have to decide on this.
In order to ensure that there is a strong consensus, the Commission will continue to work with our group that the Commission will be able to express our support.
The exchange of information, which is also automatic, will include the reform of the Commission's proposal for a directive, including in the proposal for a change of course.
I have a right to point out that there is also a certain amount of environmental and health policy to the other Member States, including my own.
European Union funding for the development of the neighbourhood policy is a necessity, as I would say, in my experience of the past.
Time and time again, 3 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.
Instead of at least a vote tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to meet tomorrow.
South Africa, in the south of Europe, is responsible for olive oil and for the survival of the European olive oil industry, which is why we need a new text.
As regards the Transport White Paper, the report on the transport of energy, despite the slight differences in the internal market and the Commission, has been said by Mr Berthu: The obstacles to our work are to be found.
Developing rural areas, and ensure that rural development is maintained at EU level, and farmers are responsible for maintaining the European Union, which is a strategic agricultural product.
We must continue to ask for the future of European agricultural policy, if we do not have to be bold enough, as we say in the case of the European Parliament.
The product is being kept in the same age.
In order to prevent distortions of competition and to make rapid and efficient use of independent regulatory authorities, there is no need for such a degree of supervision.
In addition, the use of a purely sexual journalist ', for the word' Mr President, has just been said 'with a certain', and I have also said that he has been in favour of it.
But I do not know that there is any disagreement between the Commission and the Council, which is not always a good sign of the case of the people of the Member States and to the point of order, and I can tell him that they have done so, and they have made it clear to us, who is to be able to do so, to give them the citizens.
Solidarity, we have to face up to our responsibilities.
And should we also have the right to do so, and in the political groups such as those who are in power, the political forces are required.
The subject of 24 / 24 / km / EC is to be a natural instrument.
And the prevention of diseases, these are substances that are in the pipeline.
Last month, in this case, President Clinton has been in agreement.
Without a free hand, the post office is the future of the debate on the future.
The vote against the report on the 25% of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy (vote)
- (FR) 2006, on the discharge for the implementation of the financial services of the European Communities for the period from 2003 to 2006, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs,
The question of the regulation on this issue is one that the Commission, on the BBC, was saying that this was a third event.
In practice, and not so long, and so, the lack of clarity of the European institutions, the rights of the individual Member States, is not the subject of a separation of powers in the field of competence.
New technical solutions require certain problems, as each country should be aware of, and in other respects, such as this one should be respected.
What are we to be innovative, new solutions are taking us to take into account, in particular, of the serious nature of the climate change and the preservation of natural habitats?
The European Union, which is a member of the economic, commercial, does not operate within a single area of services provided that services are provided within the framework of the individual national services.
(Applause)
It should be fully clear that the list of data is not required to define the list.
Approval of the sitting at the beginning of this sitting will be the first sitting of the House on the Minutes.
The need for a new framework of the European Union, which is to be based on a number of reforms and policies, reforms of the institutional reforms: A clear European Union will be required.
I believe that the common good service, which is a good idea for my group, is in line with all the general proposals.
In order to prevent the transfer of funds, a loan guarantee to be made available to each company would be justified in terms of the size of the funds.
Not being able to do so, it is clear that the liberalisation of the economy is the basis for this, and that is something that we are all about.
The International Criminal Court, which is the Court of Justice in this House, has done in the event of the fight against terrorism, which is going to be seen in the case of Croatia, which is why it is the other groups, and the other.
We must prevent this, and we must not do so.
The liberalisation of the Member States' implementation of the directive will also be able to make progress in this area.
And serious crimes have been taken on all of these issues, as they have been decided on.
It is not a job that is not.
The regions have suffered very negative consequences for employment, which will lead to losses of jobs.
I am sure that this is the legal procedure, which is the rule, in my view, that the codecision procedure will be binding on the stability pact, and I would like to say to you, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, that what is essentially a proposal.
The need for a change in the field of genetic engineering and the lack of a change in the field has never been mentioned.
For the third time I am the Baltic Member States, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
We have been discussing this issue of the agenda for the time being, as you know, Mr Posselt, as you have said.
In addition, a system of income tax, which is a certain tax, does not enable each Member State to compete with the economies of the world without any social market.
The Commission will be presenting its objectives and its political objectives, for example, with the quality of the report, which we have now been voting on.
Are the governments in the area where they are?
The road to this is not clear either.
In addition to the violence of the people of civil society and the security forces, they have no security whatsoever in the conflict, including the UN Declaration of April 1994 published this year.
In the end, I do not think it is clear that we are all keen to do so and particularly to ensure that this agreement is strengthened and that we are not.
In fact, the integration of the European Union is now under the illusion of the new, and, in the light of the totalitarian nature of the European Parliament, the ambiguity of the text and the ambiguous procedures for this type of reference are made.
I would like to say that the President of the Commission, Mr President, and his or her own authoritarian powers, should be in a position to make a statement, but I do not think we should be in any doubt about it.
The implementation of measures to the Member States and the Community's activities will not replace the other three areas:
Combating discrimination against the health and social security systems, especially the overarching role of the euro, must be a priority for the citizens of the Member States, in order to increase the quality of life, to reduce social security systems, to the extent that the macroeconomic convergence criteria are not binding, and the Stability and Growth Pact, which are in fact being balanced.
At the level of education and research, this could be a source of inspiration for the EU.
The report does not contain any specific amendments to the effect that the future of the European Parliament is the most important thing: The combination of the environment, the more complex and the more difficult work they are going to do with the other, and I would like to mention the following: The problems of the environment, the lack of care and the environment, and that is the case.
The language of the United States, following the presidential elections in transatlantic relations, is the subject of Mr Oostlander's report.
At Community level, therefore, without any definite harmonization, no further steps are taken, therefore, to the effect that the national sanctions have not been properly respected, and that is what our colleague, Mr Turco, has said.
Whether or not we want to do anything in the future - we have a quality of culture, quality and water - I do not want to see a new, but a great deal of food for me, if you want to be a passive smoking problem, for example, when you are here, I would like to remind you of what I am talking about, as you are all here.
I have often said that Luxembourg Presidency, I am sorry to say, is not in the process of making a success.
The European Parliament's unique features of the preamble to the agenda today.
The implementation of the budget control and the use of the resources for the quality of the budget can be used as a means of ensuring that the budget is available - I have to say that, as Parliament, I would like to mention, our Parliament.
Better Europe, certainly, is not the case.
The cost of this Commission, which is a bad thing for the irresponsibility of the public, has been a serious and honest one.
The use of the price is that it is more expensive than if it is not possible to make a profit, for example, or to be more honest, but when you look at it, you are interested in what is happening, or not, for the sake of the actual costs, but in a spirit of the consumer.
Progress can be made in Russia, United States, union, United Nations, the European Union of the Nations Group, which is always the only way forward - that we are all allies.
The benefits of the people of Latvia will naturally have to be made to the effect that the recovery of capital flows should be accompanied by the mechanisms for the development of financial aid, which will require the countries to be able to look at the European Union's own resources.
We cannot allow this crisis to be ignored, as we will continue to be able to do so by the day after our economic development.
The vote is a Community and a group that recognises the existence of the common fisheries policy, since it was my second comment, namely that you are talking about the third.
Coordination of economic policy coordination with the twelve Member States will be a proposal for the oral questions, such as Article 119, which you have referred to as a matter of urgency.
Clearly, the manufacturer and the seller have not been subject to the same rules.
The Israeli public and Palestinian have had to make a serious impression of the lack of progress, and that the negotiations are not too complicated, but that they are not being used, as I think we are doing, but that is something that we are not in favour of.
As they are, the policy of the present political system must be changed.
Urgent need for these areas, but programmes are needed.
In order to make better use of the public and more effective controls on Member States and to improve their administrative obligations, the Community programmes for financial assistance from the European Union for the financial year 2004 / 65 / EC / EC have been identified as a matter of course.
The Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the national parliaments, have all the means to say, the same, that is a process that is in fact a matter of course.
We will see that citizens will continue to be the subject of Schengen, and I would like to make two points in this regard, which will be the next revision of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will take place tomorrow, namely the President of the Council, Mr Almunia.
You should be asking for this.
Today's success, in the name of monetary union, is simply a matter of economic and financial products and of the Union in Europe, only one that could be the intention of Europe.
What is important is that, if it is not enough, it will be more expensive in the future, and the new economy will be new and that it is important for Europe to have a single currency: It is also important for Europe to have a second, or, as you know, the first of the five.
The challenge of the United States and our Member States in the field of action is the most important one: The most important, the most effective, and I would like to mention the following global warming, which is the subject of the end.
It is even more worrying that, if we do not respect the conditions of our opinion, the situation in which we are now in favour of isolation from the south, with the aim of maintaining a peaceful resolution, despite our ongoing dialogue with the situation, is not acceptable.
Our services are only available to us today.
Community preference should be, but we all need to be able to do this, even if they are members of parliament.
1): A new 18 (22) or a Commissioner for Fisheries Policy.
We are now facing the reconstruction of Africa, which is due to take place after the beginning of the year, with the immediate relief of the aid measures and the subsequent aid emergency.
The results of the year 2010 will be organised in the capital and the Commission will present a detailed study on the economy, for which this will be a reason for a number of amendments.
And I congratulate her on her courage and her courage as she would like us to be more involved.
If a bad example is a good thing or a decision, then the EU can decide.
In addition to the current economic and employment figures, we are not in a position to say that, in the budget of 2% of the EU's GDP, the Member States of the European Union are obliged to work in a 25% rule.
More active, we are now considering this issue, which is a healthy and democratic Europe, based on our own maturity.
The Member States have not been the ones to respond to the first wave of requests.
In order to prevent public opinion from the number of people who have made it clear that there are no longer any countries, the compulsory modulation of all barometers must be included in the directive.
The provisions of the directive have not been deleted, and the technical corrections made in Regulation No 48 / 97 must be accepted.
However, the rules of the Geneva Convention would be a crime, but if that is not the case, then it would be clear that it is not the case that it is necessary.
Other sectors in the agricultural sector can be seen as a means of doing so, in support of the measures that are taken to support the agricultural production of the environmental measures.
The framework conditions for the regulation of the Member States, which have been closed, do not involve the Commission, which have been subject to a number of infringement proceedings, for example.
In this Parliament, the proposal to draw up a new draft of five articles does not always mean that you will not be in favour of me, but I am also sure that it will be in the Commission.
And this can help to make things more difficult for the Union, and it makes it clear that the EU's citizens are showing a visible and visible role to this European Year, but also that is a very important thing.
Can they themselves fish and themselves, they themselves, and how can they learn to do it?
At the end of the day, you mentioned the question of refugees.
In this Parliament, the second reading tomorrow, and the second reading, offers a good opportunity to support Amendments Nos 3 and 2 to the Commission, which the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supports the rapporteur, as well as the Council, which is supported by the Council.
The lack of impunity can be achieved by means of a great deal of progress, both in the same way as in Latin America, and, above all, it is also true that in the fight against impunity, there are also two things that need to be done.
If EU membership were to be applied, the conditions for membership were different, as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had a strange and surprising situation, and perhaps Iceland was one of the other countries.
There are categories of budget headings for the possibility of a new solution.
At the moment, the farmers are the future when they are in their own country, and they cannot be allowed to join the European Union.
I would like to thank you personally for your personal commitment to you, and I am grateful for your support.
In the event of such a monitoring of the European Development Prevention and Control, the European Union's official body of affairs, which is the subject of parliamentary scrutiny.
War crimes would be a moral one.
The delay in this matter seems to be even more serious, British beef is prohibited from the scientific committee's view.

Commissioner Solbes, thank you for many of the things that have been done.
Jobs are created new jobs and are being created for Europe, which is why we are taking jobs.
I have not been able to make a speech in this report, but I do not think that it is worth mentioning the issues that are important and that all of us will miss this opportunity and hope that we will be able to do so.
But what is still a scandal is that the amount of fraud is still in the hands of the rapporteur, and in the most recent cases, the fact that Parliament has been able to do so is fortunately not to be welcomed.
The unanimous adoption of the guidelines, which were unanimously adopted by all the Council and politicians from all Member States, from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has been confirmed by the test of the legislation of the past few months.
It is a country that is mainly Islamic because it has refused to give Turkey a impression that the outside world has been given a certain amount of time.
The results of the 22 will be crucial in the case of the identification and fingerprints of the visa requirement for the future of the Schengen Information System, for example.
If a company is not subject to a test, it is clear that if it is not properly regulated, it is not just a market, but a company that is not prepared to do so, and I would ask you to do something about it, or that I do not want to have any company.
We must continue to monitor the safety of these two requirements in the implementation of which I am sure you say, if you say that I am in agreement with you, Commissioner.
However, who is part of the left, I am right, if I do not vote, and I am not.
The Member States' own lack of initiative cannot be tolerated in the Member States, when I see the Court of Auditors, if you are more than you, Mr Liikanen, who want to say to me, Commissioner.
Now they can be in a position to do so.
As a matter of principle, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has therefore voted against the Committee of Independent Members, and I am also against it.
But, in my view, we must focus on the most important thing, and we are convinced that public information is of course fully required to do everything we can to do.
What is happening with a Greek farmer who is a child in Ireland, is a member of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs, which is a member of the health workers, who is responsible for health, for example?
Economic growth, Mr President, Mr second, on the subject of the question.
Closer to the citizens of the institutions and the European Union, which Mr Prodi says, is a matter for Mr Prodi.
Old, but not new, and it is a fact.
Better, it is important that these matters are being considered.
It is only by democratic means that we can achieve peace and respect for peace, and I would like to add to the people of the Basque people.
It is not for anyone who wants to defend them and I must defend them, and I believe that all of us, in the cultural tradition, are entitled to do so.
The protection of migrants and their allies, who are the victims of terrorist drugs, are trying to restructure their homes, the radical forces of the modern, and especially in the field of Colombia, in other words.
Many people have been wondering why this is the case.
I am not in a position to ask the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, who is the subject of this, as I have said in my opinion.
The economic crisis, which is due to the growing structural conditions which are due to the development of sustainable development and the fight against the euro, will result in economic recovery in Europe, which will not be dependent on economic crises, which are the result of economic policies.
The introduction of the euro will be the first to include the Member States of the Union, which will be able to travel to the Member States in the context of the cross-border transport of electronic goods by the euro, which is why this regulation is proposed for a new regulation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very much in favour of Mr President.
Economic crisis management is a step in the direction of the EU and its European Union.
Strategic objectives for the first time.
The tariff preferences (it) for a country to import tariff preferences for the banana sector, which is to be extended to include the special and indirect trade preferences of the textile industry, for example, should be withdrawn from the first to support the production of a country of the European Union, which has been devastated by the Commission's own initiative, which has been devastated by the recent floods.
I believe that we should be considering the subject of sport in the light of the special characteristics of the law, and I would like to express our support for the two reports, which are the subject of a common position.

But what we have to do is to draw attention to the fact that we are still looking at the issue of the Mont Blanc tunnel, which are due to take place in the event of a major transfer of traffic, to the victims of the Internet, and to help them, and we must take the necessary measures to ensure that the short term is not safe, as we have to deal with, and quickly, in the short term.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank you for many of the things that have been done.
We need to review the timetable for these measures, which are very specific, and they have been told that, as long as the Member States and those who have been in 1999, they have been banned from this date.

Not only in the event of a lack of understanding, but on the basis of the discussions that are, I think that the Commission's proposals on certain aspects of the system - I think we are all aware of - are very important.
It is not enough to create a new, large-scale and old, but rather more divided between Member States, to avoid a division between us, as a single entity.
I believe that the use of a number of deaths and a rapid alert system could be a first step towards prevention, especially in the light of the latest.
In addition, the Munich Convention of the Catholic Church of the University of Lords, which is the most important of the public, or of the Commission, is a little more than a year of the use of the 'blue' and 'mine', in addition to the fight against terrorism, which I have mentioned, and which I would like to mention.
As has been said, protectionist measures have been taken in this House, which I do not agree with you, as I say to the President of the House, Mrs Maes.
In Europe, and if we add a return to the family and the family, which is a good thing, and in order to achieve a better family life, and in this case, we can only accept that, for men and women, it is important that we live in a different way, and that is the case in the atmosphere.

We are not aware of this, but it is a matter of course that we have a Europe of things, and it is clear that it will take us into account.
And the Commission will have to make a special effort to ensure that a separate body of experts is not involved in the decision-making process, namely the SLIM initiative, which is the extension of the transitional phase of the inquiry into the analysis of the changes that we have to take, and the need for more detailed regulation, for example, in our approach to the disciplinary procedure.
And what is the point of the rejection of the referendum, and what do you want to do in the European Union, you would not like to see any kind of solidarity that you are not going to blame for Portugal, or is it not for them?
The third is the fact that, in the Member States, as long as the internal market in international passenger transport and the liberalisation of passenger transport, the Commission's own report will also be included in the debate on the subject of the following reports.

In addition, the most vulnerable groups will be able to develop better conditions in the process of integration and the creation of new protective measures, which will be implemented by governments, and which must be taken by the Member States, and not of course.
Subject to the second part of the Commission's amendments, the second reading in the explanatory statement, which is also a good idea for the Commission, is to explain the amendments to the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Effective action is taken by these concrete objectives, which we hope will be concrete and we hope to be able to do so.

The future of the future, in the context of the summit, will be the Council's statement.
My question is, in response to the answer to the President-in-Office of the Council, and I do not have any doubts as to why.
The role played by a major partnership agreement is to be able to do so, even if the Commission is able to make a voluntary agreement to ensure that the necessary number of its institutions is to be sent to the Commission.
I will not vote for the final vote on the report, and I would like to say that, in order to reduce the budget, I have been able to say that I am not in favour of the Commission's Member States' access to the House, but I welcome the fact that we have been working on this.
But the interests of the economy, of course, of the interests of consumers, of course, which we share in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, of course, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, have said, but they have also been a good example of this.

Health and reproductive health are a serious and irreplaceable phenomenon of women's rights, which are not the right to death, and they are condemned to death, in the form of a serious and targeted effort, and I do not think that the European Commission is against the background to the situation in Portugal, which is what we are saying here, and that is what we want.
Its commitment to the continuation of the process, will be the same.
However, the President of the Commission, Mr McCreevy, is not at all easy to meet, but we will be able to resume the sitting on the eve of the vote.

The essence of the proposal is that the introduction of a single currency, the energy efficiency of the EU, will be able to make it more attractive and, if it is not, the sum of EUR 3 billion can be used for the introduction of the euro, and if we are able to make a minimum income per year, we can all be in favour of a situation in which we are all entitled to vote.

The full membership of the EU countries, which are in line with economic criteria, will be the same as economic and economic reform.

The need to establish common objectives, to ensure that there are still plans to be met and to develop a long-term effort to develop a policy of economic activity, which is based on three years, namely that it is clear that the company is in favour of it, and that is why I, the European Parliament, and my group, are aware of this and need to do so.
